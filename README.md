It's N0V8rs here
I'm a Student at NSCC taking Game Programming 1st year
As a 1st year student, I have learned how to code in C# in the Console & Unity
RN I am learning Godot and GDScript to learn how a different game engine works and how coding in a different IDE is

On my GitHub I have school projects I did over the past year and some of my own too
Hopefully later this year I am going to add more personal repos that I have been working on
